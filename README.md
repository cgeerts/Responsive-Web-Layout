Designer - Carter

 
Sup, I’m Carter Geerts, the designer of this masterpiece. Becoming a <br>
full-time online media designer is my dream. I’ve worked with many<br>
different programs and tools to enhance videos and image design quality.<br>
Artistic capabilities on the internet are almost endless. Smart designs<br>
can be used to increase efficiency and enjoyment. They can quickly show<br>
your abilities and strengths.I am working on expanding my YouTube channel<br>
and GitHub account as they make more great portfolios. I am working on<br>
enhancing my web design skills at Fanshawe to gain more opportunities online.

Programmer - Matt

I’m Matt Coulter, the programmer here. I am proficient in CSS<br> 
and am learning Javascript and Python. While I am more skilled<br>
in the design side of the field, I am pushing myself to improve<br>
my coding skills so that I can be a full stack developer and work<br>
on the many independent projects I want to pursue!
